\section{Installation OpenCV}

\subsection{Windows}

\begin{frame}{Installing OpenCV}{Windows 7/8}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Install Anaconda 2.0.1
  }
  \item {
    Download OpenCV 2.4.9 and extract to a convenient location
  }
  \item{
    Go to opencv/build/python/2.7 folder
  }
  \item{
    Copy cv2.pyd to INSTALL\_DIRECTORY/Python/lib/site-packages
  }
  \item{
    Open IPython QT console.
  }
  \item{
    import cv2
  }
  \end{itemize}
  If you don't get any errors, its a success.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Ubuntu}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Installing OpenCV}{Ubuntu}
\begin{block}{Using the apt-get tool}
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
\end{block}

%  \item {   
%    Second item.
%  }
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
%  \item<3-> {
%    Third item.
%  }
%  \item<4-> {
%    Fourth item.
%  }
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
%  \item<5-> {
%    Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
%  }

Transforming rich content of images into a set of values. Feature extraction is a crucial part in Machine Learning.

\subsection{Why we need feature extraction?}
\begin{frame}{Feature Extraction}{Why we need features?}
Lets say you are in an unkown country. 
To know about the country, you can see each and every house in it, and using the reference information about all houses (location and shape) in every country, you can find which country you are in.
That sounds bad, lets take an helicopter and fly. What you can see now are not houses, but streets filled with houses. You now have a feature set of smaller size (All street names in the country) which you can use to deduce the country.
Even that can be difficult, so you can fly further up and now you see cities, which should make the task fairly easy.
It is the same case with feature extraction. You look at the dataset from a higher abstraction, extract relevant features (like City names) and train your machine.
The catch here is you cannot fly so high that you see the country as a whole to directly find what it is. Using whatever abstraction possible (Similar to city names), you try to learn higher levels of abstraction (Country names).
